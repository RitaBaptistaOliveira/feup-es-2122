## Iteration 2 - Retrospective
In this iteration, in terms of app development, we implemented a selector button to
be able to see the departments by floors on the map. The zoom of a specific department 
was fixed and now works perfectly fine.

New tests were added and some of the previous were fixed. We think we made more progess
in this part of the app development compared with the last iteration. On the other hand,
we werenÂ´t able to dynamically get data from sigarra using JSON; this is something to
work on during iteration three.

With the end of this iteration, we realized that three iterations might not be enough to
reach all of our goals. We find it more important to have less, but more high quality features, instead
of many unfinished and unpolished ones.
