## Iteration 3 - Retrospective

In the last iteration,in terms of app development, we implemented a selector button that shows diferent
points of interest which belong to a certain department, like coffe machines, bathrooms or even MB machines.
We added more unit tests and fixed the acceptance ones, but still had some difficulties in the latter.
Unfortunately we weren't able to show the location of the user by scanning a QR code, since we weren't able
to get the scanner to work for our specific needs.
With the end of this iteration and project, we have the notion that, with more time, we could've come
up with a way to implement all the desired features, but overall we are happy with the results and we think our
features are successful and well implemented.
