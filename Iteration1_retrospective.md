## Iteration 1 - Retrospective

In this iteration, in terms of app development, we made the entire FEUP's map appear in the screen, we also made a selector button to be able to see the departments highlighted on the map.

The zoom of a specific department is not working perfectly fine, but to make up for it, we started to develop another feature that was not programmed to do in this iteration (QR code scanner).

Although we implemented an unit test and an acceptance test, we did not manage to get them to work. It's something we want to improve on during the next iteration.
During iteration 1, we learned how to work with the flutter tools basics, and mainly, how to divide the work to do through all members of the team, using git functionalities like tasks and issues.

Meeting the stipulated deadline of the project is something that scares us a bit, because we have a lot to implement, in a new language code, in 3 weeks only.
